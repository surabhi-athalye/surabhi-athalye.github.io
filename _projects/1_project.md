AEGIS (Automatic Extensible Generic Invariant-based Security) is an attack detection mechanism for the protection of critical infrastructure. The algorithm reads the CAD files and/or P&IDs of the system to obtain the connections between the components. Based on encoded fundamental principles, the algorithm automatically generates the logic-based rules (called invariants) that the associated sensor-actuator sets must follow for the proper operation of the system. The actual system behaviour is then matched against this expected performance to check for any process anomalies. The detector employs several generalised design parameters and device-specific constants that allow users to customise the tool for their particular systems.
